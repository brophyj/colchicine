# Data

Data will include 7 studies from the previous meta-analysis[@RN32] as well as the CLEAR[@CLEAR] data\   

```{r}
df_forest <- readRDS("output/ma_freq.rds") # read in previous MA data from 00_ program

ma_8 <- bind_rows(
  tibble(Study = df_forest$Study[c(1:7)], RR = df_forest$RR[c(1:7)], 
         Lower= df_forest$Lower[c(1:7)], Upper = df_forest$Upper[c(1:7)]),
  tibble(Study = "CLEAR", RR = 0.99, Lower = 0.85, Upper = 1.16)
)

# Discussion {.unnumbered}

This analysis contrasts two Bayesian strategies:

**File 02** uses a *sequential Bayesian updating approach*, where the CLEAR trial is analyzed assuming a normal likelihood and incorporating three distinct priors: a weak prior, an optimistic prior (COLCOT), and a meta-analysis prior derived from earlier studies. Although this model does not include an explicit `tau` parameter (between-study heterogeneity), it does **implicitly account for τ** when using the meta-analysis prior, since that prior was generated by integrating over the joint posterior distribution of μ and τ from a previous hierarchical model. Thus, τ is **not ignored**, but rather **marginalized over and embedded within the prior**.

**File 03** adopts a *Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis* approach, simultaneously estimating μ and τ using data from all 8 trials. It directly models the between-study heterogeneity and uses the posterior predictive distribution to forecast the outcome of a future study.

| Feature                     | Sequential Update (File 02)                             | Hierarchical Meta-Analysis (File 03)                   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **What is estimated?**     | Posterior effect in the CLEAR trial                    | Predictive RR for a new trial                         |
| **Uncertainty in τ**       | Carried via meta-analysis prior (integrated)           | Modeled explicitly in the likelihood                   |
| **Inference type**         | Conditional on CLEAR + prior                           | Marginal predictive over all trials                   |
| **Interval width**         | Narrower (e.g. 0.86 [0.77, 0.96])                      | Wider (0.84 [0.63, 1.08]) due to τ + sampling         |
| **Interpretability**       | Trial-specific (CLEAR)                                 | Generalizable, forward-looking                        |
| **Usefulness for policy**  | Prior-sensitive, easier to communicate                | Stronger for planning, forecasting, synthesis         |

In summary, the sequential update approach is well-suited to interpret a single trial in light of prior beliefs, while the hierarchical model offers a more conservative, realistic assessment of what might happen in future studies. Ideally, both should be reported in tandem.
